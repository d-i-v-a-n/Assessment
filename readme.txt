Hi!

The Database is already seeded some dev test data. I haven't implemented auto create of the database due to time.
Moderator account: 
	moderator@thisapp.co.za
	P@ssword

Normal user accounts (they all use the same password "P@ssword"):
	divanjbrt@gmail.com
	normal.user.1@thisapp.co.za
	test@test.co.za
	test1@test.co.za
	normal.user.2@thisapp.co.za

The entry point of the app is WebApi.
Please run in Debug mode (it was the only one tested and has swagger).

The Login request in postman will set the auth token up for all other authed requests.
